## Easy

### question 1

Sort flights to find the most delayed flights. hint(use desc( )).

```{r two-plus-two, exercise=TRUE}

```

## Modrate 

### question 2

write the code to find the Flights that left the earliest.

```{r two-plus-three, exercise=TRUE}

```

## Hard

### question 3

show top 10 flights that traveled the farthest and top 10 that traveled the shortest?

```{r two-plus-four, exercise=TRUE}

```

### Question 1 

```{r quiz}
quiz(
  question(" ________ function is similar to the existing subset() function in R but is quite a bit faster.",
    answer("rename"),
    answer("set"),
    answer("filter", correct = TRUE),
    answer("subset")
  )
)
```

### Question 2

```{r quiz2s}
quiz(
  question(" Columns can be arranged in descending order too by using the special ____ operator.",
    answer("asc()"),
    answer("desc()", correct = TRUE),
    answer("descending()"),
    answer("subset")
  )
)
```

## Intermediate

### Question 3

Make a new variable called delay which will be the total delay from departure to arrival.

```{r delay, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
library(nycflights13)
flights

```

```{r delay-hint}
flights$delay <- flights$arr_delay + flights$dep_delay
```

### Question 4

In the previous question, we made a new variable called delay. Now let's arrange the delay in descending order.
```{r arrange, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=TRUE}
flights

```

```{r arrange-hint}
arrange(flights, desc(delay))
```

## Challenging

### Question 5

Now that we got the total delay, let's try to find if there is any relation between the distance travelled and delay. If there is any relation then analyze the case for each flight (carrier) using facet.

```{r arrange_delay, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=TRUE}
flights

```

## Easy
### Exercise 1

Run the code below and figure out what is printed.
```{r 1, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=TRUE}
arrange(flights, year)
```

### Exercise 2  

Use desc() to re-order by a column in descending order.
```{r 2, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=TRUE}
arrange(flights, dep_delay)
```

## Intermediate
### Exercise 3

Find the fastest flight on March 5 2013.
```{r 3, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=TRUE}

```

### Exercise 4

```{r quiz_y}
question("Missing values are always sorted at where? ",
  answer("head"),
  answer("middle"),
  answer("Anywhere you designate"),
  answer("end", correct = TRUE)
)
```



## Advance
### Exercise 5

Calculate the difference between the flight that travelled the farthest and shortest.

```{r 5, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=TRUE}

```

## Dang

## Easy

### Exercise 1

Quiz

```{r quiz_d}
quiz(
  question("Which of the following are considered arguments in arrange() ?",
    answer("data"),
    answer(".data", correct= TRUE),
    answer("by_group"),
    answer(".by_group", correct= TRUE)
  )
)
```

### Exercise 2  

Quiz  

```{r quiz_d2}
quiz(
  question("Using arrange() function, where are NA values located ?",
    answer("top of the data"),
    answer("randomized"),
    answer("end of the data", correct= TRUE)
  )
)
```

##  Intermediate

### Exercise 3

Arrange flights based on descending dep_delay  

```{r 3_d, exercise=TRUE}
arrange(flights, desc(dep_delay))
```

### Exercise 4

Arrange flights based on ascending distance

```{r 4_d, exercise=TRUE}
arrange(flights, distance)
```


## Advanced

### Exercise 5

Make a new column in flights dataset called speed where speed = distance/air_time. Arrange flights based on descending speed
```{r 5_d, exercise=TRUE}
flights$speed = flights$distance/flights$air_time
arrange(flights, desc(speed))
```
